h1. This is a very basic HTML page to be tested using you "@reset.css@" style sheet.

h2. The reasons

It is all about the pros and cons on using reset style sheets.

The most important thing to remember is: 

A reset style sheet must show the html content in a *readable* and *useful* way.

h2. Example:

Here is an image of what can be considered a *readable* and *useful* HTML being exhibited:

* "Sample":http://github.com/marcric/basic_html_test_page/html_basic_test_result.png

Usage:

1 - Put your "@reset.css@" file with this HTML page together in the same folder and double-click the HTML file.
2 - Compare the resulting exhibited page with the sample image provided.

Suggestions and improvements are always welcome.
